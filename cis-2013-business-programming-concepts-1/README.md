## Business Programming Concepts I

## CIS-2013

### Course Description

An understanding of computer programming fundamentals is absolutely essential for a successful career in Computer Information Systems (CIS). From the practical perspective, your job as an Information Technology (IT) professional will very likely involve creating, evaluating, or implementing computer software solutions to business problems for your company and/or customers. As a CIS manager, you will be required to participate in or lead IT teams with personnel from across the pillars of IT, including programmers. In essence, there is no “IT” without computer software, so we need to have a grasp of programming fundamentals (and the more programming knowledge, the better).

It is important to stress here that there are some significant differences between the focus of programming in the CIS field and in other careers in computer science and software engineering. As IT professionals, CIS practitioners will focus predominantly on issues at the interfaces between different computing technologies and the most important assets to any company – its employees and customers. Programming for the IT professional is quite often the tool used to create integrated software and hardware solutions to help people solve business problems.
