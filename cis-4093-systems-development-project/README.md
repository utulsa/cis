## Systems Analysis and Design

## CIS-4093

### Course Description

The course is primarily intended to be a capstone experience for the undergraduate degree in Management Information Systems in which the student employs skills learned in all other MIS coursework. You will be required to deliver a project for this course that will encompass systems analysis and design, database management systems, data communications and programming languages.

This class will give each student a real-world experience with systems allowing teams to work with real customers in designing, developing, and implementing an application/system to meet a true business need. Students will be responsible for managing the projects from conceptual design to final deliverable.

The course will be run similar to how a business might be conducted. You will be accountable for completing all aspects of the applications assigned to you. I will act in the role of CIO and set clear deliverables for all milestones and the final deliverable. On the group projects, there will be one Team Leader per team, four analysts/programmers, and one Project Manager. Your role will be assigned prior to beginning your group projects.
