## CIS-3043

### Course Description

Can you think of any useful modern organizational information system that does not fundamentally require communication with components or users on multiple or external networks? Itâ€™s not an easy question to answer. In the current age of mobile and remote workforces, cloud-based services, ubiquitous smartphones, and Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) network integration, Information Technology (IT) professionals must have a fundamental understanding of the telecommunication connectivity that enables the services they create, support, and rely upon to fulfill their business needs. This course will provide a strong conceptual foundation in computer networking that is suitable for Management Information System (MIS) majors and other fields that rely upon Internet Protocol (IP)-based networks for data transport. Topic areas include network standards, network security basics, Ethernet switched local area networks (LANs), wireless LANs, internetworking, and applications. Additionally, there will be several hands-on sessions that explore Windows networking, WiFi network inspection, and UTP cable connectorizing.
